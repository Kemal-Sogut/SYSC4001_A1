Since we had a running errors at the beginning we switched 

from #include <interrupts.hpp>

to #include "interrupts.hpp"  and run :  g++ interrupts.cpp -o interrupts

If you experience any compile error you can do the same.

Replace #include <interrupts.hpp>
 with
 #include "interrupts.hpp"

 and run g++ interrupts.cpp -o interrupts  and then  ./interrupts trace.txt vector_table.txt device_table.txt
