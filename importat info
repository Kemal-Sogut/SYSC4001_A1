We had issue running the given program, 

we switched:

from   #include <interrupts.hpp>

to   #include "interrupts.hpp"  while we work on the project.

However in this scenario, it doesn't run properly

so we first run :  g++ interrupts.cpp -o interrupts

then run  ./interrupts trace.txt vector_table.txt device_table.txt



Before submission we switched back to #include <interrupts.hpp>

So in the case its not running on your computer, you can try to change it to  #include "interrupts.hpp"  and run  g++ interrupts.cpp -o interrupts
and then  ./interrupts trace.txt vector_table.txt device_table.txt
